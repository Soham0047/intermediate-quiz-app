# intermediate-quiz-app
A Python quiz application using OOP principles and a graphical user interface (GUI). The program reads questions from a data source, displays them with a GUI through `tkinter`, and tracks user responses. It provides feedback, shows scores, and ends when all questions are completed. Great for learning OOP, GUI development, and quiz logic.
